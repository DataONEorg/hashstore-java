HashStore is a server-side python package implementing a content-based identifier file system for storing and accessing data and metadata for DataONE services.  The package is used in DataONE system components that need direct, filesystem-based access to data objects, their system metadata, and extended metadata about the objects. This package is a core component of the [DataONE federation](https://dataone.org), and supports large-scale object storage for a variety of repositories, including the [KNB Data Repository](http://knb.ecoinformatics.org), the [NSF Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/), the [DataONE search service](https://search.dataone.org), and other repositories.

DataONE in general, and HashStore in particular, are open source, community projects.  We [welcome contributions](https://github.com/DataONEorg/hashstore-java/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in many forms, including code, graphics, documentation, bug reports, testing, etc.  Use the [DataONE discussions](https://github.com/DataONEorg/dataone/discussions) to discuss these contributions with us.

## Documentation

Documentation is a work in progress, and can be found on the [Metacat repository](https://github.com/NCEAS/metacat/blob/feature-1436-storage-and-indexing/docs/user/metacat/source/storage-subsystem.rst#physical-file-layout) as part of the storage redesign planning. Future updates will include documentation here as the package matures.

## Development build

HashStore is a Java package, and built using the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) build tool.

To install `hashstore` locally, install Java and Maven on your local machine,
and then install or build the package with `mvn install` or `mvn package`, respectively.

We also maintain a parallel [Python-based version of HashStore](https://github.com/DataONEorg/hashstore).
